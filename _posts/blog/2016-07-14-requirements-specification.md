1. It is essential that the requirements definition and specification documents describe the problem, leaving solution selection to the designers. The best way of ensuring that you do not stray into the solution space is to describe requirements and specifications in terms of environmental phenomena.
2. There are a variety of sources and means for eliciting requirements. There are both functional and quality requirements to keep in mind. The functional requirements explain what the system will do, and the quality requirements constrain solutions in terms of safety, reliability, budget, schedule, and so on.
3. There are many different types of definition and specification techniques. Some are descriptive, such as entity-relationship diagrams and logic, while others are behavioral, such as event traces, data-flow diagrams, and functions. Some have graphical notations, and some are based on mathematics. Each emphasizes a different view of the problem, and suggests different criteria for decomposing a problem into subproblems. It is often desirable to use a combination of techniques to specify the different aspects of a system.
4. The specification techniques also differ in terms of their tool support, maturity, understandability, ease of use, and mathematical formality. Each one should be judged for the project at hand, as there is no best universal technique.
5. Requirements questions can be answered using models or prototypes. In either case, the goal is to focus on the subproblem that is at the heart of the question, rather than necessarily modeling or prototyping the entire problem. If prototyping, you need to decide ahead of time whether the resulting software will be kept or thrown away.
6. Requirements must be validated to ensure that they accurately reflect the customer's expectations. The requirements should also be checked for completeness, correctness, consistency, feasibility, and more, sometimes using techniques or tools that are associated with the specification methods you have chosen. Finally, you should cerify that the specification fulfills the requirements.
